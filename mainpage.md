Huck's Useless CAS               {#mainpage}
============
Started as a basic implementation of Schoof's algorithm, now has exteneded to an attempt at Computer Algebra System. God have mercy. Each structure have corresponding element concepts which ensure existence of operations, closure, and ability to construct
