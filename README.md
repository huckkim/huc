# HUC (Huck's Ugly Cas)
A small project trying to implement a basic computer algebra system

Todo
- Integers (done (using gmp))
- Gaussian Integers
- Rationals (doneish need to make wrapper)
- Polynomials 
  - Fast Fourier Transform for integer mult
  - (single var done (work on factoring for Integers?))
- Polynomials (multiple var)
- Matrices (multidim?)
  - determinant
  - characterisic polynomial / minimal polynomial
  - Decompositions
  - Spectral stuff
Probably take a while
- Algebraic functions/variables
- Transcendentals
- Differentiation?
- Integration (we can only dream)

## requirements
Requires g++-10, or access to C++20 concepts
